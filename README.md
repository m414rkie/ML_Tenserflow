# ML_Tensorflow
Forays into machine learning

This repository will hold the codes for the Tensorflow tutorials found at [Tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Install_check

A short code that verifies installation of Tensorflow and required libraries.

**Contains:**

* first.py
   * Inputs: None
   * Outputs: None
  
 ## MNIST_numerals
 
 The first tutorial. Found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner). Tutorial is designed to familiarize the reader with basic functions of Tensorflow. End result is a program that can predict hand-drawn numerals based on grayscale 28X28 pixel images taken from the MNIST dataset. Deviations from the tutorial
 include sections to save various plots, including input data as well as predictions with input data. 
 
 **Contains:**
 * second.py
   * Inputs: None
   * Outputs: 5 plots. One each of accuracy and loss, with three data plots.
   

## MIST_imdb

The second tutorial, fournd [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification_with_hub). This tutorial creates a sentiment predictor for movie reviews based on the IMDB dataset provided with Keras. Deviations include two new 'reviews' to predict which are admittedly very on the nose. Includes some plots.

**Contains:**
* tf_imdb.py
  * Inputs: None
  * Outputs: 2 plots. One each of accuracy and loss.
